= Usage with Angular 2

This chapter will briefly go through Angular 2 specific features.
For the most part you can use the API provided by the element described in other sections of the documentation.
Before jumping in, you should follow the common installation instructions which apply to all Vaadin Core Elements.

== Data-binding

In order to bind an array of items to the [elementname]#vaadin-combo-box# element, you can use normal data-binding syntax of Angular 2.
The current value property can be also bound with the two-way data-binding syntax.

See the example below to on how these features can be used your template.

[source,html]
----
<vaadin-combo-box [(value)]="myValue" [items]="myItems"></vaadin-combo-box>
----

== Integration with Forms

You can also use [elementname]#vaadin-combo-box# element in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html[Angular forms].
In order to do that, you can normally use the [propertyname]#ngControl# attribute to track the state and validity.
The only difference to normal input elements is the usage of `[(value)]` binding instead of using the [propertyname]#ngModel#.
Simple validation like the [propertyname]#required# validator is supported as well as defining custom validators.

See the example below on how to use [elementname]#vaadin-combo-box# as a form control.
[source,html]
----
<vaadin-combo-box
  label="My ComboBox"
  [(value)]="myValue"
  [items]="myItems"
  ngControl="myCombo"
  required>
</vaadin-combo-box>
